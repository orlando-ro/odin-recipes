    <h2> How to Make Iced Coffee Using Room Temperature Coffee</h2>
    <p>This is probably the easiest way to make iced coffee, assuming you have the time. All you need to do is brew coffee as you normally would, allow it to cool, and pour it over ice. Let's break it down here:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A tall glass or travel tumbler</li>
        <li>A long spoon</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
        <li>1 8-ounce cup of coffee (brewed however you would normally)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>brew an 8-ounce cup of coffe using whateber brewing method you prefer.</li>
        <li>Allow the coffe to sit out until it reaches room temperature; you can even place it in the fridge once it's down slightly.</li>
        <li>Fill a tall glass or a travel tumbler to the rim with ice.</li>
        <li>Pour the room temperature or chilled coffe into the glass. Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way.</li>
        <li>Add any additional ingredients you like in your coffee, and stir. That's it! And of course you can't drink iced coffee without a cute reusable straw.</li>
    </ol>
